A contact book manager, in the form of a console application. My final assignment for a class in the 2nd semester.

AFTER FINALIZING:
I am quite pleased with the final result. Overall learned a lot about how to implement .csv files in my projects. 
My only gripe with my work is how big the final result looks (close to 600 lines).
At some point I would like to revisit the code and try to reorganize it in different modules.
